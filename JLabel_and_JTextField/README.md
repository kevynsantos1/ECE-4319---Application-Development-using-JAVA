Application and bug1.png are apart of one code where I learned how to use JLabel. In this exercise I learned how to manipulate labels. I also learned how to use outside images.
TextFieldFrame and TextFieldTest are apart of my learning for JTextField. I also learned about implementing action listener and event handlers. It is an interface. This means we have a shell and need to make
our own methods for our cases needed.
